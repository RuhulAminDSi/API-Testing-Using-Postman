# Assignment: APIâ€™s and API Testing Using Postman

## Assignment Overview
Trainees are required to create API test cases (both positive and negative) in a Collection using Postman for various operations involving Admin, System, Agent, Customer, and Merchant functionalities. The assignment includes creating a Postman collection, generating reports, and organizing everything in a GitHub repository. Please note that generating a Newman report is a BONUS task/work.

## Scenarios

### Admin Operations
1. **Create an agent, merchant, and two random customers as Admin.**
   - **Admin Credentials**:
     - Email: `admin@roadtocareer.net`
     - Password: `1234`
   
2. **Cancel Transaction.**

### System Operations
3. **Deposit money from the SYSTEM account to the agent.**
   - **Amount Range**: 10 Tk to 10,000 Tk

### Agent Operations
4. **Deposit money to one of the customers as Agent.**
5. **Check the agent's balance.**

### Customer Operations
6. **Withdraw an amount from the agent.**
   - **Range**: 10 Tk to 10,000 Tk

7. **Check customer balance.**
8. **Send money to another customer.**
9. **Make a payment from the second customer to the merchant.**
10. **Check both balance and statement for the second customer.**

### Merchant Operations
11. **Merchant checks their own balance.**
12. **Merchant checks their own statement.**

## API Documentation
Access the transaction API URL, endpoints, header information, and demo data from the provided documentation.

## Postman Collection
Create a Postman collection based on the test cases developed for the scenarios listed above. Include negative test cases for each API request.

## Documentation and Reporting
Generate the following:
- **Postman Documentation**: Generate and add the link to the GitHub `README.md`.
- **Screenshots**: Include screenshots of the Newman report in the GitHub `README.md`. (BONUS)

## Automation Requirements
Automate API requests/flows, including:
- **Scripts**: Implement Pre-Request and Post-Response scripts for validations/assertions.
- **Variables**: Proper use of Collection and Environment variables. Set up at least two environments to ensure isolation.
- **Flow**: Chain APIs to create a sequential automated flow that runs successfully.

## GitHub Repository
### Task
Create a GitHub repository for the assignment.

### Deliverables
Include the following in the GitHub repository:
- Postman Collection
- API documentation
- Reports
- Screenshots

Ensure that all documentation, reports, and screenshots are correctly linked and organized in the GitHub repository. Alternatively, you may upload the Postman Collection, API documentation, reports, and screenshots to a specific folder in Google Drive.

## Submission
Ensure that all documentation, reports, and screenshots are correctly linked and organized in the GitHub repository or Google Drive.

Feel free to customize any specific sections or add additional details as needed!
